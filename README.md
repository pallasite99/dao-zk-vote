# ZKDAO
ZKDAO: Anonymous Voting in DAOs using Zero-Knowledge Proofs on Polkadot

## Project Description

* This project explores privacy-preserving voting for DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) on the Polkadot blockchain. It enables eligible members to vote anonymously while proving their eligibility using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) — without revealing their identity or wallet address.
* The smart contract is written in ink! and targets the Polkadot Virtual Machine (PVM). The proof of concept uses zkSNARKs (via ZoKrates or Risc0) to verify a voter's membership (e.g., inclusion in a Merkle Tree of eligible voters). Valid votes are cast anonymously and securely tallied on-chain.
* This project aligns with Polkadot’s vision of scalable, interoperable, and privacy-respecting Web3 governance.

## Research and Analysis

| Topic                         | Summary                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ink! Smart Contracts**      | Explored ink! for writing Rust-based contracts on PVM. Focused on building voting mechanisms and managing on-chain state. |
| **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkSNARKs)** | Studied ZoKrates and Risc0 as ZKP systems. Implemented simple Merkle tree inclusion proofs. |
| **Anonymous Voting Mechanisms** | Investigated Semaphore protocol and other ZK-based voting schemes to understand privacy layers. |
| **PVM Compatibility**         | Verified that ink! contracts can accept off-chain ZK proof data as input. Researched potential for future on-chain verification integration. |
| **DAO Governance Patterns**   | Analyzed existing DAO voting structures to align with realistic governance flows. |

## Conclusions
1. Feasibility: Anonymous voting in DAOs using ZKPs is achievable with Polkadot's ink! and off-chain proof generation tools.
2. Best Fit ZK Tool: ZoKrates is developer-friendly and integrates well with off-chain/on-chain communication flow.
3. Privacy-Utility Tradeoff: Off-chain proof generation ensures privacy but adds complexity to UX; future enhancements could explore on-chain verification or MPC.
4. Business Case: Anonymous, verifiable governance is essential for DAOs where vote coercion or privacy concerns exist — this adds real-world value to DAO operations.
5. Scalability Potential: Can be extended to quadratic voting, weighted voting, or privacy-preserving referendums.
